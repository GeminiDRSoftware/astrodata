Gemini Examples
===============

These examples use the |Gemini| |DRAGONS| data reduction pipeline. They use
external code to perform operations outside of |astrodata|'s capabilities.

Specifically, |DRAGONS| extends |AstroData| in its |gemini_instruments|
package. This package is a grounded example of how to extend |AstroData| for
specific instruments. All reduction functionality is supported by other parts
of the library.

To use these examples, you need to install |DRAGONS| and its dependencies.
Please follow the |DRAGONS| installation instructions at |DRAGONS_install|.
