Generic Examples
================

This section contains examples using |astrodata| with no specific instrument
or pipeline in mind. The examples are intended to demonstrate the basic
functionality of |astrodata| and to provide a starting point for users
who are new to the package.

Many of these patterns will apply broadly to anything derived from
|AstroData|. However, no "real" data is used in these examples, and
they are not intended to represent how any given reduction "should"
be done to achieve science quality data.
